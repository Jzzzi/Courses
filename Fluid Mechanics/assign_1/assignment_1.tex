\section*{Explanation}
At first, I tried using LaTeX to complete my homework,
but typing the LaTex code was too slow, so I ended up writing it on paper.

\section*{Question 1}
The specific weight can be calculated as
$$
    \r{specific} \ \r{weight}= \frac{8 \r{N}}{400 \r{ml}} = 20000 \r{N \c m^{-3}}
$$
\noindent The density can be calculated as
$$
    \r{density} = \frac{8 \r{N}}{400 \r{ml} \c 9.81 \r{N \c kg^{-1}}} = 2038.74 \r{kg \c m^{-3}}
$$
\noindent The specific gravity can be calculated as
$$
    \r{specific} \ \r{gravity} = \frac{2038.74 \r{kg \c m^{-3}}}{1000 \r{kg \c m^{-3}}} = 2.03874
$$

\section*{Question 2}
The dimension of $c$ is $[c]=\r{L \c T^{-1}}$, 
the dimension of $E_v$ is $[E_v]=\r{M \c L^{-1} \c T^{-2}}$, 
the dimension of $\rho$ is $[\rho] = \r{M \c L^{-3}}$, 
due to that $c = {E_v}^a\c \rho^b$ is dimensionally homogeneous, we can get
$$
\begin{cases}
    a + b = 0\\
    -a - 3b = 1\\
    -2a = -1
\end{cases}
\Rightarrow
\begin{cases}
    a = \frac{1}{2}\\
    b = -\frac{1}{2}
\end{cases}
$$
\noindent So we can get the relationship between $c$, $E_v$ and $\rho$ as
$$
    c = \sqrt{\frac{E_v}{\rho}}
$$
Therefore
$$
    E_v = \rho \c c^2 = 2000 \times 2000^2 \r{kg \c m^{-1} \c s^{-2}} = 8 \times 10^9 \r{kg \c m^{-1} \c s^{-2}}
$$

\section*{Question 3}
The dimension of $Q$ is $[Q]=\r{L^3 \c T^{-1}}$,
the dimension of $\Delta p$ is $[\Delta p]=\r{M \c L^{-1} \c T^{-2}}$,
the dimension of $R$ and $L$ is $\r{L}$,
the dimension of $\mu$ is $[\mu]=\r{M \c L^{-1} \c T^{-1}}$.
Considering that the equation $Q = \frac{c R^4 \Delta p}{\mu L}$ is dimensionally homogeneous,
we can finally get that \b{$\bf{c}$ is a dimensionless constant.}
Actually this equation is called Poiseuille's law, in which $c$ is equal to $\frac \pi 8$.

% \section{Question 4}
% By looking for the Appendix B we can get the density of the water at different temperature.
% $$
% \rho_{@4^\circ C} = 999.98 \r{kg \c m^{-3}}, \quad \rho_{@32^\circ C} =  \r{kg \c m^{-3}}
% $$
